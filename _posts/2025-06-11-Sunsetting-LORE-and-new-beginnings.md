after much thought, we're sunsetting **LORE**. it served us well but no longer fits our evolving vision.

with that, we are also shutting down all SeerIntelligence security services, as we are trying to fit on a more open source and intelligence based agenda.

seerintelligence is shifting focus: deeper security journaling, sharper insights, and a relentless push toward actionable intelligence.

expect cleaner tools, better data hygiene, and an ecosystem built for the long haul â€” no fluff, just raw, meaningful signals.

stay tuned for new releases. this isn't just an end, it's a strategic rebirth.

questions? feedback? hit us up.
