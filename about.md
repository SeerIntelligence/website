# Who are you?

seerintelligence is a tight-knit crew of infosec junkies obsessed with documenting threat actors and the shifting cyber landscape. we put out papers, analyses, and raw intel—always free, no strings attached.

we focus on two main projects: the directory, a curated collection of everything we know about the threat actors we track, and the observatory, our self-built platform to monitor their activity in real time.

operating on a modest hobby budget means progress is slow but steady. everything we uncover will eventually be shared publicly—no paywalls, no gatekeeping. it’s about transparency and collective awareness.

we do this purely for the love of the game, driven by curiosity and a commitment to open knowledge, not profit or prestige.
